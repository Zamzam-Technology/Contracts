# Zamzam Token

ERC20 token 

$ZAM is the native token that powers the Zamzam Ecosystem and can be used for transactions on-chain, paying for fees on the network, making cross-border transfers, exchanged, staked, and used for liquidity mining.
With interoperability in mind and the idea being that users can seamlessly exchange digital assets from one blockchain to another, $ZAM is intended to be used as a universal bridge token for CeFi and DeFi.
Initially, $ZAM has cross-chain support for two of the most widely used blockchains in the world: Ethereum & Binance Smart Chain. In the future, support for other blockchains will be added.
The value of the $ZAM token is derived from revenue generated by the Zamzam ecosystem. Part of the revenue is directly invested in $ZAM. As network adoption increases, the value of $ZAM increases.
